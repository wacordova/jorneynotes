# My name is William and welcome to my jorney notes!
# These are notes that I've taken along my start in the tech industry.
# My specific field of study is Cyber Security (Blue Team).
# My inner builder's nature would love to become a Security Engineer.
# My career path has also led me to want to go to the offensive side of Cyber Security (Red Team).
